The Problem is shown in the following picture



I just want to reduce the useless space, which I have when I work or do other stuff on my second monitor there are should just 1 or more popouts with simply Python GUI with the scaled video. without anything with chrome. maybe with the youtube bar but thats enough, important is that the video is upscaled and autoplay in highest resolution.
It also could be have Options to rescale for different monitor formats. I'm on WQHD but on 4K it shouldn't work like the WQHD Version
